# Productivity

## Goals
This repository will contain tools that help the author achieve their goals.  This is intentionally broad, but early steps may include work tracking, to-do list, and reminder functionality.

## Operational Principles
* When possible, information should be available via a web browser (including, minimally, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox)
* Data should persist beyond the duration of a user's session
* Data should be stored and retrieved securely.  While admin access to data is unlimited, no other user should be able to see any potentially private information
* A large part of this exercise is gaining experience developing tools.  In some cases this may mean dupilcating functionality found elsewhere
